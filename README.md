# nf-wgs

Nexftlow workflow for basecalling and mapping of whole genome Nanopore fastq reads using dorado, minimap2, samtools and multiqc.

Requires either [Docker] or [Apptainer] installed.

Usage:

```sh
nextflow run chusj-pigu/wf-mapping [--pod5 INPUT] | [--fastq INPUT] [--ref REF_GENOME] [OPTIONS]
```

To list available options and parameters for this workflow, run :

``` sh
nextflow run chusj-pigu/wf-mapping --help
```

Overview:

This workflow can be run locally or on Compute Canada. To use on Compute Canada, use the `-profile drac` option. For testing purposes, basecalling can be run on cpu only with `-profile test`.

## 1. Basecalling

Basecalling is done with [Dorado] on duplex mode with modified base calling by default, using the Super accurate algorithm. The pod5 files are first split by channel to facilitate duplex calling. To use without modified basecalling, use the `--no_mod` option. This can be done in simplex mode using the `--simplex` option, or entirely skipped using the `--skip_basecall` option.

## 2. QC stats and filtering

QC plots are generated by [NanoPlot]. Reads that have a QS score <10 will be classified as failed, and subsequent steps are only carried out on reads with QS score >= 10.

## 3. Mapping

If using `--skip_basecall`, the workflow will start here using `--fastq` as input. Mapping of the reads is done with [minimap2] using `-ax -map-ont` options for long reads generated by Nanopore sequencing. Mapping can be skipped with `--skip_mapping`.

## 4. Sorting and indexing

Using [samtools], the .sam file is first converted to .bam using `samtools view`, sorted with `samtools sort` and indexed using `samtools index`. Mapping statistics are computed with [mosdepth].

## Outputs

Generates a .sam file, .bam files for sorted reads and bai for indexed reads. Mapping statistics are stored in text files and summarized in a [multiqc] report.
